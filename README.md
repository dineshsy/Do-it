## Principle
* The core feature of this app is Posture Recognition using Artificial Intelligence.
* We had seen many many fitness apps in our day to life. Which gives us the information and instruction to the exercises that they have.
* Yes, they say how to do it, but they never correct your posture.
* So personally as a team of two. We built this App to recognise your posture and show the areaswhich you need to concentrate for imporoving your posture.

## Enough discusion let us see the App itself

### Dashboard

In here the exercises are displaye.
User can select the exercise for his need.

### Let us assume the user selects Warrior 1 pose

The short description and instruction of that posture will be produced to the user.
Then the user can upload his posture. i.e., He must try the warrior 1 pose and give us the picture of it.

### For example like this.

### Relax the server will do its part

The above picture will then used by server and convert it to a skeletal image, like this.
